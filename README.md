## Lyrics

```

Whoop Whoop Whoop

Whoop Whoop Whoop

Whoop Whoop Whoop

Let them know we already on the brink
Themes of death pulling us out of sleep 
distant approach i'm missin' it

Let them know we already on the brink
Themes of death pulling us out of sleep  yeah
distant approach i'm missing it
let them think, what's so wrong
playful rest, never plannin' bliss

distant approach i'm missin' it

Let the bass say that
can i say that Cannet ey sa
Let them know we already on the brink
Themes of death pulling us out of sleep 
to approach so Distinct so distinct


Let somebody generate

desolate desolate 
comprehend this

Let them know we already on the brink
Themes of death pulling us out of sync aye
to approach so (distinct), so distinct yeah


```
